-- Initial Idea: 2/4/25 --

This game will be looking into the gender roles and tropes that have remained prevalent in video games historically and even today. In order to highlight the absurdity and harm of these stereotypes, this game will invert the expected portrayals of the male and female characters.

The level takes place in a typical fantasy world where the ruff, tough female protagonist must save the helpless, alluring male side character. The playstyle will be more point and click within static environments as the character has to continue through the village and to the dungeon to rescue the fair lord, with three settings: the village, the forest, the dungeon.
