-- 2/4/25 Notes --

Started out with figuring out which game engine is the best to use:
 Unreal Engine:
- Pros: most experience with engine, many more assets to use
- Cons: powerful engine, not best to use for more visual novel style games
 Unity:
- Pros: have used before, good engine to use for more 2d-style games
- Cons: not much experience scripting in Unity, limited free assets
 Renpy:
- Pros: best program to use for visual novel-style games
- Cons: never used before so would require extra time to learn program, would have to create all assets on my own
 Godot:
- Pros: good program to use for 2d games
- Cons: very limited knowledge of the program
Right now Unity seems like the one I will most likely use

Looked at possible assets for both Unreal and Unity
- Stylized environments: trying to find assets that would blend well together in one space
- Decided on necessary environments: dungeon and forest
	- Possibly include village as intro-level if enough time
- Unreal Assets:
	- Stylized - Nanite Dungeon Pack by Studio Kobo
	- Dreamscape: Stylized Environment Tower - Stylized Nature Open World Fantasy by Polyart Studio
	- Advanced Village Pack by Advanced Asset Packs
- Unity Assets: 
	- Stylized Fantasy Armory - Low Poly 3D Art by Daniel Mistage
	- Stylized Hand Painted Dungeon by LS2 Arts
	- Simple Forest Pack by Soft Poly Studios
	- Stylized Low Poly Nature Lite by JustCreate
	- URP Stylized Water Shader - Proto Series by BitGem

Began brainstorming story and gameplay:
- Will most likely be static or side-scroller due to time constraints
- Puzzle-based and obstacles
	- Possibly very limited/simple fight mechanics

To Do:
- Decide on game engine
- Find references for characters and start simple sketch-ups (mostly just silhouettes)
- Start storyboard


-- 2/8/25 Notes --

Decided on Unity for the game
- Added assets to game file
	- Ran into hot pink materials: had to convert the asset materials to URP, seems to have fixed the problem
	- All assets seem to be working, except for stylized water, may take it out

-- 2/11/25 Notes --

Remembered to actually push the progress on GitHub and add the game project to the repository

-- 2/14/25 Notes --

Found references and started on sketches of the two main characters
- Still very rough, but getting a good idea of what the silhouettes of the characters should look like

-- 2/15/25 Notes --

Worked on bedroom level
- Added assets for bedroom props from SketchFab
	- Set of Stylized beds by Peter Nox
	- Set of Stylized cupboards by Peter Nox
	- Set of stylized shelves and desks by Peter Nox
	- Modular Fantasy Assets by j8cov
	- Stylized Wood PBR Material by nikola
Got the character controller and the camera movement set up and working. There might be a few finetuning needed in the future, but so far looks good for a start. 
- With my own character still being sketched out, put in a place holder just to visualize how it works. 
	- Even without the animations of a sprite sheet, the player movement looks fine. I'm gonna be changing around my planning a bit and just focus on getting one good static image of the character rather than rushing through animations for the sprite sheet, so that if time runs out, I'd prefer a good-looking static character moving around than a half-finished animation.
	- Since the start of the game really only focuses on the female protagonist, I'll be prioritizing getting a rough draft of her character design finished before working on the male in distress character design

To Do Tomorrow:
- Write out draft of the letter that starts the quest
- Make the letter pick-up able in game

-- 2/16/25 --

Worked on the visuals of the letter that starts the quest.
- I was thinking about how this letter could further showcase the inverted gender roles. I ended up looking at different adjectives that would usually be labeled as feminine or masculine and reversed those as well in the letter.
- One challenge I've come across is the font, trying to find balance between making the writing fit in with the setting and narration, but still making sure the font is legible for majority of people. I did end up sacrificing the 'fanciness' of the writing to make sure it'd be easy to read for players. I've also decided to go a more pixel/retro overall look for fonts and UI.

Started working on a rough objectives list so the player knows what needs to be collected in the game.
- Added a backpack asset from SketchFab for this: Adventure Bag by Yury Misiyuk
- Got the simple objectives done where the item vanishes from the task list once completed. Also added a dialogue pop-up when the character approaches the door, the text differing depending on if the tasks are done or not.

-- 2/18/25 --
- Finalized documentation for class. Worked on Canva whiteboard.

-- 2/22/25 --
Switched to a different style for the trees, looks fuller and more appealing in my opinion. 

-- 2/24/25 --
Continued to work on forest. Got a good set up of the entire forest's layout, if time will go back to add more details and make it feel fuller/livelier.

--2/25/25 --
Finished up the forest environment base. I decided to focus on finishing up the environments of all three levels first before going into the mechanics and code, since those will most likely be linked or similar in both the forest and dungeon level.

Got started on the dungeon level. For this level, I possibly want a more "platformer" feel in addition to continuing to find clues and tools, so might add some chasms the player needs to jump over to avoid dying. To create the deadly chasms, I decided to create traps on the bottom, so I added a few spike models from Sketchfab.

-- 3/1/25 --
Continued working on the dungeon environment. I have the base layout set up, with where the lord will be held and where the key to his cell will be hiding. Just need to add in a few details and imperfections, and then the environments should be completed.

-- 3/4/25 --
Updated the dungeon environment and added components that will be interactable.
My biggest priority now is getting the designs of the characters into Unity and fully working. Once that is completed and fully functionating, I will go back and focus on getting as much of the mechanics working as I can before next week.
