Started out with figuring out which game engine is the best to use:
 Unreal Engine:
- Pros: most experience with engine, many more assets to use
- Cons: powerful engine, not best to use for more visual novel style games
 Unity:
- Pros: have used before, good engine to use for more 2d-style games
- Cons: not much experience scripting in Unity, limited free assets
 Renpy:
- Pros: best program to use for visual novel-style games
- Cons: never used before so would require extra time to learn program, would have to create all assets on 	my own
 Godot:
- Pros: good program to use for 2d games
- Cons: very limited knowledge of the program
Right now Unity seems like the one I will most likely use

Looked at possible assets for both Unreal and Unity
- Stylized environments: trying to find assets that would blend well together in one space
- Decided on necessary environments: dungeon and forest
	- Possibly include village as intro-level if enough time
- Unreal Assets:
	- Stylized - Nanite Dungeon Pack by Studio Kobo
	- Dreamscape: Stylized Environment Tower - Stylized Nature Open World Fantasy by Polyart Studio
	- Advanced Village Pack by Advanced Asset Packs
- Unity Assets: 
	- Stylized Fantasy Armory - Low Poly 3D Art by Daniel Mistage
	- Stylized Hand Painted Dungeon by LS2 Arts
	- Simple Forest Pack by Soft Poly Studios
	- Stylized Low Poly Nature Lite by JustCreate
	- URP Stylized Water Shader - Proto Series by BitGem

Began brainstorming story and gameplay:
- Will most likely be static or side-scroller due to time constraints
- Puzzle-based and obstacles
	- Possibly very limited/simple fight mechanics

To Do:
- Decide on game engine
- Find references for characters and start simple sketch-ups (mostly just silhouettes)
- Start storyboard

Decided on Unity for the game
- Added assets to game file
	- Ran into hot pink materials: had to convert the asset materials to URP, seems to have fixed the 	problem
	- All assets seem to be working, except for stylized water, may take it out

Remembered to actually push the progress on GitHub and add the game project to the repository

Found references and started on sketches of the two main characters
- Still very rough, but getting a good idea of what the silhouettes of the characters should look like

Worked on bedroom level
- Added assets for bedroom props from SketchFab
	- Set of Stylized beds by Peter Nox
	- Set of Stylized cupboards by Peter Nox
	- Set of stylized shelves and desks by Peter Nox
	- Modular Fantasy Assets by j8cov
	- Stylized Wood PBR Material by nikola
Got the character controller and the camera movement set up and working. There might be a few finetuning needed in the future, but so far looks good for a start. 
- With my own character still being sketched out, put in a place holder just to visualize how it works. 
	- Even without the animations of a sprite sheet, the player movement looks fine. I'm gonna be 	changing around my planning a bit and just focus on getting one good static image of the character 	rather than rushing through animations for the sprite sheet, so that if time runs out, I'd prefer 	a good-looking static character moving around than a half-finished animation.
	- Since the start of the game really only focuses on the female protagonist, I'll be prioritizing 	getting a rough draft of her character design finished before working on the male in distress 	character design
