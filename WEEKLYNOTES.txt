-- 2/4/25 Notes --

Started out with figuring out which game engine is the best to use:
 Unreal Engine:
- Pros: most experience with engine, many more assets to use
- Cons: powerful engine, not best to use for more visual novel style games
 Unity:
- Pros: have used before, good engine to use for more 2d-style games
- Cons: not much experience scripting in Unity, limited free assets
 Renpy:
- Pros: best program to use for visual novel-style games
- Cons: never used before so would require extra time to learn program, would have to create all assets on my own
 Godot:
- Pros: good program to use for 2d games
- Cons: very limited knowledge of the program
Right now Unity seems like the one I will most likely use

Looked at possible assets for both Unreal and Unity
- Stylized environments: trying to find assets that would blend well together in one space
- Decided on necessary environments: dungeon and forest
	- Possibly include village as intro-level if enough time
- Unreal Assets:
	- Stylized - Nanite Dungeon Pack by Studio Kobo
	- Dreamscape: Stylized Environment Tower - Stylized Nature Open World Fantasy by Polyart Studio
	- Advanced Village Pack by Advanced Asset Packs
- Unity Assets: 
	- Stylized Fantasy Armory - Low Poly 3D Art by Daniel Mistage
	- Stylized Hand Painted Dungeon by LS2 Arts
	- Simple Forest Pack by Soft Poly Studios
	- Stylized Low Poly Nature Lite by JustCreate

Began brainstorming story and gameplay:
- Will most likely be static or side-scroller due to time constraints
- Puzzle-based and obstacles
	- Possibly very limited/simple fight mechanics

To Do:
- Decide on game engine
- Find references for characters and start simple sketch-ups (mostly just silhouettes)
- Start storyboard
- Look into simple sprite sheets
